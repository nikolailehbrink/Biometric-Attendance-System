# BiometricFingerprintsensor
 The project work for the microcontroller course in the sixth semester of Bremen University of Applied Sciences, 2020.

## Functionality:
With the aid of the microcontroller, it should be possible to compare fingerprints from different people with previously stored fingerprints. If the comparison is successful, a success message is output via an LCD display. It is also possible to read in admin fingerprints using a master password entered via a pin pad.
